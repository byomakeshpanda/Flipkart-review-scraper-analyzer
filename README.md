# Flipkart Review Scraper and Text Analyzer


## Overview

This project is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to scrape product reviews from Flipkart and analyze the sentiments and text data. The app enables users to enter a Flipkart product URL, which is then used to scrape all the reviews for that product. The scraped data is then processed and analyzed to generate visualizations like bar charts for review ratings, a pie chart for sentiment distribution, and a word cloud for text analysis.

## Features

- **Review Scraping**: Users can enter the URL of any product on Flipkart to scrape all its reviews.

- **Data Analysis**: The scraped data is processed to generate insights like the distribution of review ratings and sentiment analysis.

- **Word Cloud**: The app generates a word cloud from the processed text data to visually represent the most frequently used words in the reviews.
